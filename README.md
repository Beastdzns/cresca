## Cresca - DeFi Lending & Yield Platform on Aptos

Cresca is an innovative decentralized finance (DeFi) platform built on the Aptos blockchain. It combines lending, borrowing, smart yield optimization, and merkle trade, all while maximizing capital efficiency. Cresca introduces a unique approach: instead of storing collateral idly, it deploys it into liquidity pools, enhancing yield for lenders and reducing borrowing costs for users.

### Features


- **Lending & Borrowing**: Users can lend assets to earn yield and borrow efficiently with better rates.

- **Smart Yield Optimization**: Collateral is actively deployed into liquidity pools to generate continuous returns.

- **Merkle Trade Integration**: Supports secure and verifiable off-chain trade settlements.

- **Capital Efficiency**: Maximizes liquidity usage without compromising security.

- **User-Friendly**: Streamlined interface removes the friction of interacting with multiple dApps.

## Problem Statement 

Traditional DeFi lending protocols lock collateral, leaving it idle and underutilized. Borrowers face high interest costs, while lenders earn limited returns. Cresca addresses these inefficiencies by actively deploying collateral into liquidity pools, creating a more efficient and profitable system for all participants.
